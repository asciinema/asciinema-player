# asciinema player

[![Build status](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/actions/workflows/build.yml)

__asciinema player__ is a web player for terminal sessions recordings.

Unlike typical web _video_ players, which play heavyweight video files (`.mp4`,
`.mov`), asciinema player plays lightweight terminal session recordings in the
text-based [asciicast](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/asciicast/v2/) format
(`.cast`), such as those produced by the [asciinema
recorder](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/cli/).

The player is built from the ground up with JavaScript and
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ([WASM](https://webassembly.org/)), and is
available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciinema-player) and a
[standalone JS
bundle](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/releases/latest).

You can use it on any HTML page - in a project documentation, on a blog, or in a
conference talk presentation.

It's as easy as adding a single line of Javascript code to your web page:

```javascript
AsciinemaPlayer.create('demo.cast', document.getElementById('demo'));
```

Check out the [quick start
guide](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/quick-start/) for basic setup
overview.

You can see the player in action in [asciinema
documentation](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/).

Notable features:

* ability to copy-paste terminal content - it's just text after all!
* smooth, timing-accurate playback,
* [idle time optimization](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#idletimelimit) to skip periods of inactivity,
* [posters](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#poster),
* [markers](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/markers/) for navigation or auto-pause,
* configurable [font families](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/fonts/) and [line height](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#terminallineheight),
* [automatic terminal scaling](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#fit) to fit into container element in most efficient way,
* full-screen mode,
* [multiple color themes for standard 16 colors](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#theme) + support for 256 color palette and 24-bit true color (ISO-8613-3),
* [adjustable playback speed](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#speed),
* [looped playback](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#loop), infinite or finite,
* [starting playback at specific time](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/options/#startat),
* [API for programmatic control](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/api/),
* [keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/shortcuts/),
* [support for other recording formats](https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/parsers/) like ttyrec, typescript.

## Building

Building asciinema player from source requires:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/),
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) compiler (1.77 or later) and [Cargo package
  manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

To build the project run:

    git clone https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player
    cd asciinema-player
    git submodule update --init
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run bundle

This produces following output files:

- `dist/index.js` - ES module, to be `import`-ed in your JS bundle
- `dist/bundle/asciinema-player.js` - standalone player script, to be linked directly from a website
- `dist/bundle/asciinema-player.min.js` - minimized version of the above
- `dist/bundle/asciinema-player.css` - stylesheet, to be linked directly from a website or included in a CSS bundle
